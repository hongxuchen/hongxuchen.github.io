          enddate: 2020.09
        points:
          - I lead the architecture design of a fuzzing service which provides a general-purpose interface for different
            testing scenarios, such as embedded systems, the automotive-relevant microcontrollers, stateful protocols, etc.
            I am also involved in a data-based reverse engineering research to help decompose the functional components
            of a given project.

          enddate: 2019.12
        points:
          - I maintain the fuzzing framework FOT. Meanwhile, I am also involved in a high-performance cross-CPU
            binary fuzzing framework BiFF, as well as a fuzzing technique called MUZZ that aims to boost fuzz testing
            on multithreaded programs.
      - heading:
          label: Research Intern @ Scantist Pte. Ltd. - Singapore, Singpaore
          startdate: 2018.09
          enddate: 2019.05
        points:
          - I co-designed and built the prototype of a cross-CPU grey-box fuzzer for binaries.
      - heading:

          startdate: 2014.05
          enddate: 2015.08
        points:
          - I focused on LLVM based data flow analysis which aims to improve the dynamic fuzzing effectiveness with
            the aid of static analysis.
      - heading:
          label: Research Intern @ Microsoft Research Asia - Beijing, China
          startdate: 2013.02
          enddate: 2013.11
        points:
          - I focused on improving the white-box fuzzing technique on patching programs with the help of static analysis;
            I implemented a static analysis tool that can slice the underlying program for subsequent white-box testing.
